### Two main points

1. Ethics is not about your beliefs, habits, and predilections, but about a **group's consensus on what is the right behavior** of its members that will ensure optimal operation and longevity, whatever the domain or subject matter of interest of the group. 	

2. Ethics can be about everything and anything, but it **requires whole-system analysis** in every case.


### Answer the Questions

1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?

   i. What means ethical is to have unethical, with would then put a system of utopia in which no one would require punishment. One of those would the court of law that would obviate because no one is abiding anything ethical. 

2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.

   i. The American army during the Vietnam war was not a very good place to be in, naturally not in any war. It is typical to strip individualism from a soldier awaiting to go to battle, machines that are required to have no sense of wrong unless told so. This war in particular was very foggy and not really clear until it was too late. This proved that many people will be told to do something without adhering the consequences at the other side, this led to many soldiers to the brink of madness. The cost of this individualism was uncontained and led to plenty of innocent people murdered as well as their image of liberators (which they were never). This group was also better the bigger, despite losing about 50 thousand men in battle the ones who did return were not men but soldiers to the american army. 

3. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). An ethical code relies on the _cooperation_ of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka _defection_) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the [prinsoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) and the eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?

   i. An ethics code usually contains a hard leveled point against the acts of the commons. The commons tragedy will usually come into place when conflict has hit the workplace or shares in the companies. This would leave many to fend for themselves even creating, which is the prisoners dilemma which in this case would be employees taking part in prioritizing their own self-interest. Having a company that has lots of untapped resources that can be _data_, that compromises other people's personal information can lead to many others fleeing from this controversial setting. Rogue behavior, as promoting self interest, will most likely be contagious. Many employees who are working for high level companies might feel the need to keep their occupation or else latch onto what they can before getting screwed over. This behavior promotes the illicit practice of using un-approved resources for self gain. This inevitably lands a company on its heels to deal with any person who has taken advantage and led the way for the companies demise. A downfall by such practice will find many to blame that can put people on the defense and quickly point fingers to assure their security and assurance away from any prosecution. Some incentives to keep integrity to the ethics code integrated would be to promote good behavior with extra bonus, continuing a good leadership and not a laizzer-fare, as well as assuring confidentiality to employees who have witnessed anyone abiding the code with also punishments to those who commit anything worthy of compromising the company's safegaurd. 


### Class Activities
_Note: Class activities are group but individual submissions are required for grading._
 
1. In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small _tech_ startup. Then:
   1. List the group members below.
      a. Dwight C. 
      b. Denika C.
      c. 
   2. Pick a president and write their name below.
      a. Dwight C. 
   3. Describe your technical innovation below.
   Facial Recognition Home Security.
   
2. Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society. 
   1. Below, list at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to _misuse_) of the innovation and anticipatory actions and mechanisms you can embed that
      a. System can be misused to Racially profile against people of a certain race or ethnic group.
      b. System could enable entry and exit of traffickers/abusers to contain people within. 
      c. 
   2. Below, give an _explicit_ definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of its lifetime: (i) immediately upon launch; (ii) after enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life.
      i. The security system allows Authorities to integrate the technology to work against thiefs with their facial recognition for tracking and implementing law, work with early incarceration rights for minors that are caught commiting crimes. 
      ii. Invasive security might overwhelm neighbors in an apartment complex that can cause tension between the user and those being recorded. 
   
3. Your small "[band of merry psychopaths](#the-band)" are the pivotal social kernel that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early, and hold the line. How are you going to ensure that you stay the course? 
   1. Below, define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization that will safeguard your original intentions and values while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have _at most 9 points_.
      Code of ethics is a guide for their principles designed to continue developing and working with the technology with honesty and integrity. This code of ethics works to consider, protect, and maintain the data of the user. 
        a.Data is large intangible value, it is to remain confidential.
        b.Program dedicated to facial security recognition to remain in hands of employed programmers. 
        c.Selling of technology to people of heavy criminal records, prohibited.
        d.Technology is to remain as one trademark, no trade/exchange or data with second carrier allowed.
        e.Data transfer to authorities, co-users, or anyone under liable control must be consented by original user. 
        f.Any other use of tech other than perimeter film must be approved by the chair, liablity is limited.  

4. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to _hostile takeover_ of the adopting organization. Pick one person from your group and let them _remove 3 points_ from your Code, at their discretion, to be the most damaging overall. 
   1. Below, discuss how and why the Code has been weakened.
   2. Below, discuss how, in retrospect, you should have stated the points of the Code, to make it _robust to disruption_. _Note: Beware of the [paradox of self-amendment](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psaessay.htm), which, in short, **"...arises when a rule is used as the authority for its own amendment. It is sharper when the rule of change is supreme, sharper still when it is changed into a form that is inconsistent with its original form, and sharpest of all when the change purports to be irrevocable."**_
   i. By removing the code of who gets to handle the data, allowing for any use of the technology by any means, and allowing users to manipulate the programs intended to safegaurd a home has now made the company as well as the code incredibly weak. The reason being is that of advantage being used by self-interests by the user who can be using it for the greater bad. This code relies on security on passerbyers and those helf within. The tech is than heavily misused to the point where the tech no longer serves the purpose of security and more of surveilance of neighbors or people held within. 


#### The Band
The derogatory expression _band of merry psychopaths_ is used in writing to refer to a small _group of irresponsible or deliberately hostile people with a lot of power_ to affect the world around them.
